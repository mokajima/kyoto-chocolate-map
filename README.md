# Kyoto Chocolate Map

Kyoto Chocolate Map is a web application that lists chocolate shops in Kyoto. You can filter locations with a text field. Clicking a location on the list or a marker of the location displays unique information about the location. I use [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) to provide the information.

## Install

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
